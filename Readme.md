Hereâ€™s your **updated README documentation** based on the most recent changes in functionality across your files:

### Code References

#### Files

---

### NPCController.cs
- **Purpose**: Controls NPC movement and behavior.
- **Key Points**:
  - Moves NPCs at a set speed and flips sprite based on direction.
  - Destroys NPC when it goes off-screen.
  - Aligns the bottom of the sprite to a given Y-coordinate.
- **Usage**: Attach to your NPC prefab (requires a SpriteRenderer). No major changes.

---

### SpawnZoneData.cs
- **Purpose**: Defines vertical boundaries for NPC and Customer spawns.
- **Key Points**:
  - Uses a BoxCollider2D to calculate minY and maxY at runtime.
- **Usage**: Attach to a spawn zone object (requires a BoxCollider2D). No changes in logic.

---

### NPCSpawner.cs
- **Purpose**: Spawns both NPCs and Customers into the scene.
- **Key Points**:
  - Spawns NPCs at regular intervals.
  - Spawns Customers manually via the `spawnCustomerDebug` flag.
  - Spawns Customers only if a free `OrderArea` is available (managed by `OrderAreaGroup`).
  - Customer spawn and NPC spawn logic are separated into `SpawnCustomer()` and `SpawnNPC()`.
- **New Dependency**: Requires an `OrderAreaGroup` reference to manage available order spots.
- **Usage**:
  - Attach to a spawner object.
  - Assign references to `npcTemplate`, `customerTemplate`, `spawnZone`, and `orderAreaGroup`.
  - Toggle `spawnCustomerDebug` to manually spawn a customer.

---

### CustomerController.cs
- **Purpose**: Controls Customer movement, target assignment, and simple text bubble display.
- **Key Points**:
  - Moves toward an assigned `OrderArea` instead of a hardcoded coordinate.
  - Text bubble displays "..." while walking and "Order" when arrived.
  - Logs and updates the assigned `OrderArea` upon arrival.
- **Usage**:
  - Attach to a customer prefab.
  - Include a child GameObject with a speech bubble (with a Text component).
  - Use `SetOrderArea()` from the spawner to assign a target.

---

### OrderArea.cs
- **Purpose**: Represents a single spot at the counter where a Customer can order.
- **Key Points**:
  - Tracks if the spot is currently occupied.
  - Provides coordinates for customer navigation.
  - Contains a trigger event for customer presence.
- **Usage**:
  - Attach to counter spot GameObjects.
  - Each should have a Collider2D set to trigger.
  - Called by the spawner and customer to set availability.

---

### OrderAreaGroup.cs
- **Purpose**: Manages multiple `OrderArea` components as a pool.
- **Key Points**:
  - Provides a method to fetch the first free order spot.
  - Can reset/release an occupied spot later via `ReleaseOrderArea()`.
- **Usage**:
  - Attach to a GameObject containing multiple child `OrderArea` objects.
  - Automatically collects them on Awake().
  - Used by `NPCSpawner` to assign a valid order spot to a new customer.
